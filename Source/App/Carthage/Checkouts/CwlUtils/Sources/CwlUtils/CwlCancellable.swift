/// This protocol exists to provide lifetime and termination capabilities to asynchronous an ongoing tasks (an implementation of the "Disposable" pattern).
///
/// Implementation of this protocol implies that an instance manages an underlying resource that will be set to en "end-of-life" state when the instances falls out of scope. The `cancel` function can be invoked to force this "end-of-life" state *without* falling out of scope.
///
/// This protocol implies a behavior that is *not* enforced by the interface. Namely: deallocating a `Cancellable` should have the same effect as calling `cancel` (although `cancel` need not be invoked on dealloc). Usually, this requirement is ensured by `cancel` in the `deinit` method, however, directly invoking `cancel` on dealloc is not required by this protocol, merely the transition to "end-of-life" state. Specifically, `struct` implementations of this protocol will usually contain a `class` instance that will apply the `cancel` behavior when deallocated.

/// An additional expectation is that calling `cancel` multiple times be "safe" and generally idempotent (the second call should be a no-op).
